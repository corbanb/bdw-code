### Week 6

This we are going to work on some jQuery examples to learn about the jQuery selector and how we can use them to manipulate our HTML pages as well as AJAX. These are two of the most fundamental techqiues you will use to edit your pages.

- Learning jQuery selectors ([main.js](01_html_and_js/js/main.js))
- Learning AJAX ([facebook.js](01_html_and_js/js/facebook.js))


#### Running code on the server

Open find to your week6 folder and double click `server`. This file will allow you to our code just like any website such as [http://google.com](http://google.com) except our code can now be found at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

For now the how is not important its the what we are doing that is.
